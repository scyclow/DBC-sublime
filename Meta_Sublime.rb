WHYAMIHERE? 
*********
-Mice suck


PUSH YOURSELF
*************
-Add a new shortcut each day

-Think about how you are typing:
	*  It's really hard to hit these buttons... Room for changing keystroke

	*  I wish I could... Probably a way to make a keystroke for that.

	*  Am I looking at my keyboard? If yes, don't do that.

	*  Are you using both command, option, and SHIFT keys?

-Am I defaulting to less efficient keystrokes?

-Keys are buttons, chain them together and you get action : think in actions
